Geometry:


Optimizations:
- when retrieving images, once their original size is known, you can know how to cache them for the next time you need to load it.
    - or at least set a maximum image size
    
- Disk Caching.  Consider SDWebImage


Retrieval:
- test other types of retrieval methods

BUGS:
-----

Retrieval of first image when cycling around seems to have problems.  Might be a thread blocking thing.
