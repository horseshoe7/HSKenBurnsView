Geometry:


Optimizations:
- when retrieving images, once their original size is known, you can know how to cache them for the next time you need to load it.
    - or at least set a maximum image size
    
- Disk Caching.  Consider SDWebImage


Retrieval:
- test other types of retrieval methods

'The Algorithm' (animateLayer: ... method):

- expose more parameters so people can make it a lot more customizable:
    - max movement distance
    - allow more variance in the movement. 
    
- document the algorithm so people can tweak it / improve it.

- Improve API such that the calculations are more granular and not in one big method


BUGS:
-----

- got an NSRangeException when starting with puppies, then changing to Remote in the demo.  Did a hotfix but didn't track it down.  Change the hotfix to a big NSLog and a breakpoint for when it's about to fail.  (line 676)
